            	<dt>What is the Austin Homicide Project?</dt>
      				<dd>The Austin Homicide Project is an effort by the American-Statesman to document homicides in Austin and Central Texas, and to provide a database of information about the cases so the community can stay informed. This database is currently tracking all homicides starting in 2013, including justifiable homicides and cases classified as murders by the Austin Police Department. Not included are deaths such as suicides or traffic fatalities, which the Travis County medical examiner's office generally classifies as "accidents." Over time, the project will expand to include jurisdictions outside of Austin and prior years</dd>
    			</dt>
  			</dl>
                
  			<dl>
    			<dt>What is a "homicide"?</dt>      
        			<dd>A homicide happens when one human causes the death of another human and it is one of the five categories the Travis County medical examiner's office uses to explain the circumstances surrounding how someone died. The other four "manners of death" are "natural," "accident," "suicide" and "undetermined."</dd> 
        			<dd>Not all homicides are murder. In 2012, for example, the medical examiner's office determined that 38 of the more than 1,000 deaths that doctors investigated that year were homicides, including the deaths of people killed in officer-involved shootings. However, the Austin Police Department only classified 33 of all homicides in the city that year as murders.</dd>
              <dd>A murder is a criminal homicide that a person commits under <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.19.htm" target="_blank">the state's penal code</a> if he or she intentionally or knowingly causes the death of an individual; if he or she intends to cause serious bodily injury and commits an act clearly dangerous to human life that causes the death of an individual; or if he or she commits or attempts to commit a felony, other than manslaughter, and in the course of doing so causes the death of an individual.</dd>
    			</dt>
  			</dl>
  			<dl>
    			<dt>Why does the Austin Homicide Project include killings by law enforcement officers?</dt>
    				<dd>Since the definition of a homicide is one person causing the death of another, homicides include criminal slayings and justifiable slayings by police, as well as justifiable homicides by a person in self-defense. The term does not imply wrongdoing.</dd>
            <dd>"There is a big difference between when we use the word 'homicide' and the court uses 'murder,'&thinsp;" said Satish Chundru, deputy chief medical examiner for Travis County. "Homicide to us, in the simplest form, is just the death of a person at the hands of another."</dd>
    			</dt>
  			</dl>
            <dl>
    			<dt>Does the Austin Homicide Project include all homicides?</dt>
    				<dd>The database may not always include the exact number of homicides that happened in a given year due to limited information. Law enforcement agencies often classify certain details about homicide victims, sometimes including the victim's name. In some cases, officials say, suspects in homicide investigations may not be aware that a victim has died, information that could make it more difficult to make an arrest.</dd>
            <dd>The total number of homicides is also subject to change as the medical examiner makes rulings in deaths from prior years.</dd>
            <dd>This database will be updated with homicides not already included as we learn enough information about the cases.</dd>
    			</dt>
